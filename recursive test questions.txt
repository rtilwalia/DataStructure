1.Take as input String.

2.Take as input Integer "i" which I used to verify your return type String.

a. Write a recursive function which counts the number of times ‘hi’ appears in the string. Print the value returned.

b. Write a recursive function which removes all ‘hi’ in the string. Print the i'th index character.

c. Write a recursive function which removes all ‘hi’ in the string. Print the output (return type void).

Input Format

String representing S. An integer for index.

Constraints

Size of String may be large.

Output Format

print the output.

1.Take as input N, a number. N is the size of a 1 dimensional snakes and ladder board (without any snakes and ladders).

2.Take as input M, a number. M is the number of faces of the dice.

a. Write a recursive function which returns the count of different ways the board can be travelled using the dice. Print the value returned.

b. Write a recursive function which returns an ArrayList of dice values for all valid paths across the board. Print the value returned.

Input Format

Two integers n,m

Constraints

1<= n <=1000000000
